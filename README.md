# Omega Red
The main purpose of this project is to redesign the original PCSX2 for making more simple and friendly user interface for users without complex structure of control component. The original project has complex user interface for regular users (in my view). It has power tools for creating "patches" for game, but I, as a gamer, do not need all of them - I need only a couple buttons for launching my favorite game. Another purpose is to add a touch screen control for Windows 10.
